# Note if the mount point is not started with a slash (/) it will show up as an external device in the
# files app. For most people this will be the prefered method. To unmount the network drive, just press the
# eject button in the files app. For network drives mounted on top of a directory you will need to run the
# script with "sudo mountcifs stop"
